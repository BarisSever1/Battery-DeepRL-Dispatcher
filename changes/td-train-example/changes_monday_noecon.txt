Changes before td3_monday_noecon2 training:
- Disabled economic reward component; critic now optimizes only the shaping terms (inventory, peak bonuses, SOC incentives).
- All SOC-related incentives are action-based: pre-peak charging/descharging rewards/penalties and post-peak discharge/charge penalties scale with current power so gradients depend on the taken action.
- Future-aware price deltas and reward breakdown columns (base vs shaping vs final) are logged into quick/eval CSVs for diagnosis.
