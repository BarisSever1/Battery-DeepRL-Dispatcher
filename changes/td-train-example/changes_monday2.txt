Changes before td3_monday2 training:
- Reward shaping weights now combine fixed base + proportional parts:
  * Peak bonuses: base 35 â‚¬/MW + 110 â‚¬/MW scaled by power * price premium.
  * Off-peak penalties: base 2.5 â‚¬/MW + 35 â‚¬/MWh scaled by absolute discharge.
  * Cheap-hour bonuses: base 6 â‚¬/MW + 24 â‚¬/MW scaled by action fraction.
  * PV bonuses: base 4 â‚¬/MW + 16 â‚¬/MW scaled by PV fraction.
  * High-price charge penalty: base 12 â‚¬/MW + 45 â‚¬/MWh scaled by power.
- Post-normalization peak reward: base (0.3 morning / 0.4 evening / 0.2 other) + 0.3Ă—action_fraction when discharging, with -0.25 penalty if SOC>min+5% and not discharging.
